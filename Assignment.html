CP331 - Assignment 2#
<br> Due 5:30 pm, Thursday, March 16 , 2017. Submit PDF file and source code by email.   
<br><br>
Rules for submitting can be found in the course outline. 
Assignment is to be done by groups of three students. 
<br><br>
Each group should contact the instructor for information on how to access the virtual machine on which the code should be tested.

(problem from P. Pacheco, Parallel Programming with MPI)
<br>
A more accurate alternative to the trapezoidal rule is Simpson's rule.  The basic idea is to approximate the graph 
of f(x) by arcs of parabolas rather than line segments. 
Suppose that p &#60; q are real numbers, and let r be the midpoint of the segment 
[p,q].  If we let h = (q-p)/2, then the equation for the parabola passing through the points 
(p,f(p)),(r,f(r)), and (q,f(q)) 
is


<br>
<!
\frac{h}{3}[f(p) + 4f(r)+f(q)]
>

<! y = \frac{f(p)}{2h^2}(x-r)(x-q) - \frac{f(r)}{h^2}(x-p)(x-q) + \frac{f(q)}{2h^2}(x-p)(x-r)  >

<br>
<br>If we integrate this from p to q, we get
<br>
<!
\frac{h}{3}[f(p) + 4f(r)+f(q)]
>

<!
\int_a^b f(x)dx \doteq \frac{h}{3}[f(x_0)+4f(x_1)+2f(x_2)+4f(x_3) \\ +  \ldots + 2f(x_{n-2}) + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)]
>
<br><br> Thus, if we use the same notation that we used in our discussion of the trapezoidal rule and assume that n, the number of subintervals of [a,b]
, is even, we can approximate

<br><br>Write 3 programs:
<br>
<br>1. a serial program 
<br>2. an MPI  parallel program  
<br>3. an OpenMP parallel program 
<br>
<br>
that use Simpson's rule to estimate the integral of

<br> for some function f of your choice that can be integrated exactly, allowing you to check your answer.
<br>
<br> You can assume that the number of processes or threads is less than n/2. However, do <b> not </b> assume that n/2 divided by the number of processes is an integer.  
Aim to assign the same amount of work to all processes or threads, as far as that is reasonably possible.

<br>
<br> 4. Time all three codes to study their performance on hopper, your own laptop/desktop, and/or other multicore computers indicated by the instructor.
